1). Install: Fuse
2). Get a link to a DropBox linked folder
3). Extract the contents of this software and navigate to the software
    folder in command-line.
4). Create an empty directory used during mounting the remote folder,
    for instance : mkdir mnt
5). Run the command:
    python dropfuse.py <dropboc.com url> mnt/
    
    To get you started, I have created a public folder link that you can
    test this on:
    
    https://www.dropbox.com/s/c6ecc2plwconh5x
    
    
    At this moment if everything goes well, you should see a drive mounted
    and named 'mnt'. Open it and use it in a file browser.
    
    To stop using the mounted drive type:
    fusermount -u mnt/
    
    or:
    
    umount mnt/
